Design a systems architecture that, by consuming a provided API, will return the best* flight for the user using the API specifications:

    1. You may use whichever architecture you think is best, but keep in mind the core business logic will have to be written in Typescript/NodeJS.
    2. You may define the scope and depth of your design according to your preference
    3. Define different scenarios considering assumptions like:
        a. the price for the API usage
        b. the updating frequencies of the API results
        c. the "best*" definition

Your design will be evaluated based on the following criteria:
    1. Scalability
    2. Cost-effectiveness
    3. Ease of maintenance and development
